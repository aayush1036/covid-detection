# Covid Detector

With this project, we aim to create a covid detection classifier which classifies the x-ray as covid or not covid. This may save time for the patient where the reports are being generated within 20-30 mins, the customer can upload the x-ray and get tentative results which the customer can use to take precautionary measures. 

Data - We have taken the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ahemateja19bec1025/covid-xray-dataset">Covid chest x-ray dataset</a> from Kaggle

Basically this is what we do<br>
